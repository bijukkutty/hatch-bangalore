					<h1>Common Good</h1>
					  <p class="first-letter">
					  We live in a world that sees nature and culture as resources there for us to exploit. We pollute our land, rivers, lakes, air and even our food, dominated by commercial interests, careless of toxic byproducts in the name of development and progress. In the same way we are polluting our cultural landscape. The industrialist mentality that is prevalent today has reduced people to "workers" or "human resources", seen as interchangeable cogs, often treated as machines and now often replaced by machines. Everything and everyone is reduced to commodity and all human worth is measured by productivity, gain and control. Dignity and values are stripped from humanity. We have lost the idea of common good in our lives and the necessity of it for both individual and social flourishing. Culture of anxiety, over commoditization and fear of scarcity that we created has failed us all.
					  </p>
					  <p>
					  This ancient idea of Common good has been lost, but can and should be sought again. The need for a new dialogue about what it means and what its practice would require of us has never seemed more critical. This idea has origins in the beginning of Biblical narrative. It hinges in the greatest commandment Jesus gave about loving our neighbour as ourselves and even loving our enemies.
					  </p>
					  <p>
					  A commitment to the common good could bring us together and solve the deepest problems our neighbourhoods and the world now face: How do we work together? How do we treat each other, especially the poorest and most vulnerable? How do we take care of not just ourselves but also one another?

							What if we see creativity as a gift for economic, cultural, environmental and individual flourishing and not as commodity?

					  <p>What if we see creativity as a gift for economic, cultural, environmental and individual flourishing and not as commodity? What if we commit to foster fresh imagination and meaning into culture where creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship can serve the common good?</p>
					  <p>We believe that arts and technology can play a significant role in shaping our Common life by modelling and exhibiting rehumanizing values. Let’s Create has a dream to become an ecosystem to foster artists, designers, writers, technologists, scientists, businessmen, philosophers, etc., to cultivate Common good in our neighbourhoods, cities, nations and the world.</p>
